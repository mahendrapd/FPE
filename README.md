Feature Probability Estimation (FPE)
-------------------------------------
We have deployed an FPE Library on Python that users can directly use by installing the library and importing the data. 
Install the Library by typing the following pip command in the terminal:
<h3>
pip install fpe-lib==0.1.2
</h3>
<br>
This GitHub directory contains all programs that are <br>
1. Execute FPE using Library ( <i><b>fbelib.py</b></i> ) <br>
2. Execute FPE with code ( <b><i>fpe.py</i></b> ) <br>
3. Execute classification methods used in the paper ( <b><i>classification.py</i></b> ) <br>
4. Execute different feature selection methods (PCA, FIS, Kbest, and RFE) used in the paper ( <b><i>fsp.py</i></b> )<br>
5. Execute Information Gain (IG) feature selection method used in the paper ( <b><i>igp.py</i></b> )<br>
6. Execute Mutual Information (MI) feature selection method used in the paper ( <b><i>mip.py</i></b> )<br>
7. The detailed information about the FPE library is in the documentation file (<b><i> FPE_Lib_Documentation.pdf </i></b>) <br>
<br><br>
Final processed datasets of different feature selection methods are uploaded to this GitHub repository. It also includes outcomes of feature selection methods, classification methods, and processed training and test sets.
