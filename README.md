Feature Probability Estimation (FPE)
-------------------------------------
We have deployed an FPE Library on Python that users can directly use by installing the library and importing the data. <br>
Install the Library by typing the following pip command in the terminal:
<h3>
pip install fpe-lib==0.1.2
</h3>
<br>
This GitHub directory contains all programs that are <br>
1. Execute FPE using Library ( <i><b>fbelib.py</b></i> ) <br>
2. Execute FPE with code ( <b><i>fpe.py</i></b> ) <br>
3. Execute classification methods used in the paper ( <b><i>classification.py</i></b> ) <br>
4. Execute feature selection methods used in the paper ( <b><i>fscif.py</i></b> )<br>
5. The detailed information about the FPE library is in the documentation file (<b><i> FPE_Lib_Documentation.pdf </i></b>) <br>
<br><br>
There are other data uploaded on this GitHub repository, like outcomes of feature selection methods, classification methods, processed training and test sets, etc.
